A server is just a computer that is connected to the internet, and usually always on. 

Servers can be run on the cloud or run on premise. 

I love building my own computers and creating servers, it was one of my personal joys. I also detest the anti-compensative nature of big tech. If it was up to me this server would be running on a gentoo box on the 4th floor.

However, we live in a society, the school takes their security very seriously so if I was to host the server locally, either the school would have to give me special permissions and break president or the app would have limited functionality. I can not run the server myself because then the project would die. 

The solution for this delemia is to use cloud, but not be at the behest of the deadly FAGMAN (facebook, apple, google, microsoft, amazon, netflix). I will use Linode, because I really like their philosophy and they have an excellent product.  

Almost all server in the world run Linux, linux has many flavours. While most servers will run a debian based distro I feel like that does not teacher you anything. Linux and open source computing is beautiful and complicated, I think though it might be scary the best place to learn it is from the simplistic distro; simple not in difficulty but in how much the distro offers. Gentoo is my faveolate distro, it is
