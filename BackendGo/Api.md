# API / Backend

My API is a simple rest api in go. 

An API (application programming interface) is simply a connection between two programs. 

REST (representational state transfer) APIs or RESTful api is just standard architecture for getting data on the web. 

This rest api will run on a server. A server is just a computer that is connected to the internet, and usually always on. While personally I hate cloud hosting, I feel that because I will not be in CIS forever, and the CIS firewalls are too intense, I will use a linode server.
